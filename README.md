# Inertial Sensors in Consumer Applications

This repository contains materials, experiments, and code related to the use of inertial sensors in consumer applications. Inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, are used in a wide range of consumer devices to measure motion, orientation, and acceleration, enabling features like activity tracking, gesture recognition, and stabilization.

## Overview

Inertial sensors play a crucial role in providing input data for various consumer applications, such as:
- **Fitness Trackers**: Tracking activity and steps.
- **Smartphones**: Screen orientation changes, gaming control, and navigation.
- **Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR)**: Monitoring head movement and improving user experience.
- **Gaming Consoles**: Motion sensing for interactive gaming experiences.

This repository aims to explore these consumer applications in-depth, demonstrating how inertial sensors can be leveraged in creative and practical ways.
